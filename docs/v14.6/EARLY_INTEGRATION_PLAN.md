# Early Integration Plan - Goxel v14.6

**Date**: January 2025  
**Lead Agent**: Sarah Chen

## Opportunity Assessment

With Agent-2 (Aisha) completing the daemon infrastructure ahead of schedule, we have an opportunity for early integration testing while other agents complete Phase 1.

## Integration Priorities

### 1. Immediate Integration (Days 6-7)
**Participants**: Agent-2 + Agent-3
- Integrate Yuki's JSON-RPC protocol with Aisha's daemon
- Validate socket communication with protocol messages
- Test basic request/response flow

### 2. Binary Integration (Days 8-9)
**Participants**: Agent-1 + Agent-2
- Integrate Marcus's unified binary with daemon mode
- Test mode switching and initialization
- Validate headless daemon startup

### 3. Test Integration (Days 9-10)
**Participants**: Agent-4 + All
- James creates integration tests for completed components
- Performance baseline against working daemon
- Stress test socket server

## Benefits of Early Integration

1. **Risk Reduction**: Identify integration issues early
2. **Performance Validation**: Test actual daemon performance vs estimates
3. **Parallel Development**: Other agents can test against real daemon
4. **Documentation**: Elena can document working system

## Action Items

### For Agent-1 (Marcus):
- Prioritize daemon mode initialization hooks
- Focus on integrating with Aisha's daemon_main.c

### For Agent-3 (Yuki):
- Begin implementing JSON-RPC client against real daemon
- Validate protocol design with actual implementation

### For Agent-4 (James):
- Create integration test harness immediately
- Start performance benchmarking with real daemon

### For Agent-5 (Elena):
- Document actual daemon behavior
- Create early integration guide

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Basic daemon starts and accepts connections
- [ ] JSON-RPC echo method works end-to-end
- [ ] Performance meets <2ms latency target
- [ ] No memory leaks in 1-hour test run
