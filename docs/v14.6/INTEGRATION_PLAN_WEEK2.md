# Goxel v14.6 Week 2 Integration Plan

**Lead Agent**: Sarah Chen  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Sprint**: Week 2 Integration

## Integration Overview

Week 2 focuses on integrating the parallel work streams from Week 1. This plan ensures smooth collaboration between all agents as we merge their components into the unified architecture.

## Integration Timeline

### Day 8-9: Pre-Integration Preparation
**All Agents**:
- Complete current tasks to stable checkpoint
- Document any interface changes
- Prepare integration test cases
- Update API contracts if needed

### Day 10-11: Core Integration (Integration Point 1)
**Primary**: Agent-1 + Agent-2
- Merge unified binary with daemon infrastructure
- Integrate mode detection with process management
- Test daemon startup from unified binary
- Validate both GUI and headless modes work

**Support**: 
- Agent-3: Provide protocol interface specifications
- Agent-4: Run integration tests
- Agent-5: Document integration process

### Day 12-13: Protocol Integration
**Primary**: Agent-2 + Agent-3
- Connect socket server to protocol handlers
- Implement method dispatcher
- Test basic JSON-RPC communication
- Validate error handling

**Support**:
- Agent-1: Ensure proper initialization hooks
- Agent-4: Performance benchmarking
- Agent-5: API documentation updates

### Day 14: Full System Integration
**All Agents**:
- Complete end-to-end testing
- Performance validation
- Documentation review
- Prepare Week 3 plans

## Integration Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Binary Modes (Day 10)
```bash
# Both should work:
./goxel                    # GUI mode
./goxel --headless --daemon # Daemon mode
```

### Checkpoint 2: Socket Communication (Day 11)
```bash
# Daemon should accept connections:
./goxel --headless --daemon &
nc -U /tmp/goxel.sock      # Should connect
```

### Checkpoint 3: Protocol Handler (Day 12)
```bash
# Basic RPC should work:
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"daemon.version","id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/goxel.sock
# Expected: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"version":"14.6.0"},"id":1}
```

### Checkpoint 4: Full Integration (Day 13)
```bash
# Complete workflow:
./goxel --headless create test.gox
./goxel --headless add-voxel 0 0 0 255 0 0 255
./goxel --headless export test.obj
```

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync Format (Starting Day 8)
```markdown
Agent: [Name]
Today's Goal: [Specific integration task]
Dependencies: [What I need from others]
Blockers: [Any issues]
Ready to Integrate: [Component status]
```

### Integration Meetings
- **Day 8**: Kick-off meeting (virtual)
- **Day 10**: Binary integration review
- **Day 12**: Protocol integration review
- **Day 14**: Week 2 retrospective

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Binary Conflicts**: Mode initialization conflicts
   - Owner: Agent-1
   - Mitigation: Clear #ifdef boundaries

2. **Socket Compatibility**: Protocol/socket mismatch
   - Owner: Agent-2 + Agent-3
   - Mitigation: Early interface validation

3. **Performance Regression**: Unified binary slower
   - Owner: Agent-4
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking

### Process Risks
1. **Communication Gaps**: Agents working in silos
   - Owner: Lead Agent
   - Mitigation: Daily syncs, shared documents

2. **Integration Delays**: Dependencies not ready
   - Owner: All Agents
   - Mitigation: Early checkpoint validation

## Success Criteria

### Week 2 Deliverables
1. ✅ Unified binary with working mode detection
2. ✅ Daemon process management operational
3. ✅ Basic socket communication established
4. ✅ Initial protocol handler framework
5. ✅ Integration test suite (>50% coverage)
6. ✅ Updated documentation

### Performance Targets
- Daemon startup: <30ms (target: <20ms)
- Mode switching: <5ms overhead
- Socket connection: <10ms
- Basic RPC round-trip: <5ms

## Agent Responsibilities

### Agent-1 (Marcus): Binary Integration Lead
- Provide integration hooks for daemon
- Ensure clean mode separation
- Resolve compilation issues
- Validate no GUI regression

### Agent-2 (Aisha): Socket Integration Lead
- Provide socket server interface
- Handle connection management
- Implement process lifecycle
- Ensure graceful shutdown

### Agent-3 (Yuki): Protocol Integration Lead
- Provide protocol handler interface
- Implement method dispatcher stub
- Define error handling patterns
- Create integration examples

### Agent-4 (James): Testing Lead
- Run integration tests continuously
- Benchmark performance at each checkpoint
- Identify memory leaks
- Validate cross-platform compatibility

### Agent-5 (Elena): Documentation Lead
- Document integration decisions
- Update architecture diagrams
- Create integration guides
- Capture lessons learned

## Next Steps (Week 3 Preview)

After successful Week 2 integration:
- Agent-1: Render backend integration
- Agent-2: Connection pooling
- Agent-3: Full protocol implementation
- Agent-4: Stress testing
- Agent-5: User guide creation

## Conclusion

Week 2's integration phase is critical for v14.6 success. With clear checkpoints, defined responsibilities, and proactive communication, we'll achieve a unified architecture that delivers >200% performance improvement while maintaining code quality.
