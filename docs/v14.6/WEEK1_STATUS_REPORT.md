# Goxel v14.6 Week 1 Status Report

**Lead Agent**: Sarah Chen  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Sprint**: Week 1-2 (Phase 1)

## Executive Summary

The Goxel v14.6 unified headless development is progressing well with all 5 agents actively working on their assigned tasks. Agent-3 has completed protocol design ahead of schedule, providing a solid foundation for implementation.

## Agent Status Updates

### âœ… Agent-3: Yuki Tanaka (Protocol & Client Engineer)
**Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETE (3 days early)

**Completed Deliverables**:
1. **JSON-RPC Protocol Design** (`JSON_RPC_PROTOCOL_DESIGN.md`)
   - Full JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
   - Binary data extensions for voxel data
   - Compression support (zlib, lz4, brotli)
   - Batch operation specifications
   - Security and authentication design

2. **Client Architecture Design** (`CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`)
   - Modular layered architecture
   - Connection pooling with load balancing
   - Retry strategies and circuit breaker patterns
   - Event system for real-time notifications
   - TypeScript-first implementation

3. **Method Catalog Design** (`METHOD_CATALOG_DESIGN.md`)
   - 50+ JSON-RPC methods across 9 namespaces
   - Complete v13.4 CLI command mapping
   - New daemon-specific methods
   - Comprehensive error code reference

**Next Steps**: Ready to begin implementation once socket infrastructure is available.

### ðŸ”„ Agent-1: Marcus Rivera (Binary Integration Specialist)
**Status**: In Progress (Day 5/10)

**Current Focus**: Build system unification
- Analyzing codebase differences
- Designing unified initialization flow
- Working on SConstruct merger

**Blockers**: None

### ðŸ”„ Agent-2: Aisha Patel (Daemon Infrastructure Engineer)
**Status**: In Progress (Day 5/10)

**Current Focus**: Socket infrastructure implementation
- Unix domain socket server design
- Process lifecycle management
- Signal handling implementation

**Blockers**: None

### ðŸ”„ Agent-4: James O'Brien (QA & Performance Engineer)
**Status**: In Progress (Day 5/10)

**Current Focus**: Test framework setup
- Creating unified test infrastructure
- Benchmarking v13.4 performance
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline

**Blockers**: None

### ðŸ”„ Agent-5: Elena Kowalski (Documentation & DevRel)
**Status**: In Progress (Day 5/10)

**Current Focus**: Documentation structure
- Creating documentation templates
- Planning migration guides
- Developer experience audit

**Blockers**: None

## Key Achievements

1. **Protocol Foundation**: Complete protocol design enables parallel implementation
2. **Clear Architecture**: All agents have clear understanding of unified design
3. **No Blockers**: All agents progressing without dependencies

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Integration Complexity**: Week 2 integration point critical
   - Mitigation: Daily sync meetings starting Day 8
   
2. **Binary Size Growth**: Unified binary may be larger
   - Mitigation: Conditional compilation strategies identified

## Week 2 Focus Areas

### Integration Points (Day 10-14)
1. **Binary + Socket**: Agent-1 and Agent-2 integration
2. **Socket + Protocol**: Agent-2 and Agent-3 integration  
3. **Test Coverage**: Agent-4 validates all integrations
4. **Documentation**: Agent-5 documents integration process

### Deliverables Target
- Unified binary compiling with both modes
- Basic daemon running with socket listener
- Initial protocol handler framework
- Test suite with >50% coverage
- Draft user documentation

## Recommendations

1. **Daily Standups**: Start daily async updates from Day 8
2. **Code Reviews**: Cross-agent reviews for integration points
3. **Early Testing**: Agent-4 to provide test stubs early
4. **Documentation**: Agent-5 to capture decisions real-time

## Conclusion

Week 1 is progressing excellently with Agent-3 completing early and no blockers across the team. The unified headless architecture is taking shape with clear separation of concerns and well-defined integration points.

**Next Checkpoint**: Day 10 - Integration Point 1
