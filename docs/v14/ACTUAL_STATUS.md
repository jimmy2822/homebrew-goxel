# Goxel v14.0 Daemon Architecture - Actual Status

**Last Updated**: January 27, 2025  
**Version**: 14.0.0-alpha  
**Author**: Lisa Wong (Agent-5)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This document provides an accurate assessment of the v14.0 daemon's current state. The daemon is in early alpha development with only basic infrastructure completed. Production use is not recommended.

## üìä Executive Summary

The Goxel v14.0 daemon represents a significant architectural shift from the CLI-based v13.4, introducing a persistent daemon process with JSON-RPC communication. While the foundational infrastructure is solid and functional, the actual voxel editing functionality has not been implemented.

### Current Reality
- **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Working (socket server, worker threads, lifecycle management)
- **JSON-RPC Methods**: ‚ùå Not implemented (0 of 10+ planned methods)
- **Client Libraries**: ‚ùå Not created
- **Performance**: ‚ùì Cannot measure (no functionality to test)
- **Production Ready**: ‚ùå No - early alpha stage

## üèóÔ∏è What Actually Works

### 1. Daemon Infrastructure ‚úÖ
```bash
# The daemon can:
./goxel-daemon                      # Start successfully
- Creates Unix socket at /tmp/goxel-daemon.sock
- Spawns 4 worker threads (configurable)
- Accepts client connections
- Processes socket messages
- Handles signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP)
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
```

### 2. Socket Communication ‚úÖ
- Unix domain socket server functioning
- Message framing and parsing
- Client connection management
- Concurrent client support

### 3. Worker Pool ‚úÖ
- Multi-threaded request processing
- Request queue management
- Priority queue support (optional)
- Thread-safe operation

### 4. JSON-RPC Framework ‚úÖ
- JSON-RPC 2.0 parser implemented
- Request/response structures defined
- Error handling framework
- Method dispatch skeleton

## üö´ What Doesn't Work

### 1. JSON-RPC Methods ‚ùå
**Status**: Not Implemented (0/10+)

None of the planned methods are implemented:
- ‚ùå `goxel.create_project`
- ‚ùå `goxel.load_project`
- ‚ùå `goxel.save_project`
- ‚ùå `goxel.add_voxel`
- ‚ùå `goxel.remove_voxel`
- ‚ùå `goxel.get_voxel`
- ‚ùå `goxel.export_model`
- ‚ùå `goxel.get_status`
- ‚ùå `goxel.list_layers`
- ‚ùå `goxel.create_layer`

The `json_rpc_handle_method()` function exists but the method registry is empty.

### 2. TypeScript Client ‚ùå
**Status**: Not Found

No TypeScript client library exists in the codebase. The planned features:
- Connection management
- Type-safe method calls
- Automatic reconnection
- Request/response handling

None of these have been implemented.

### 3. Goxel Core Integration ‚ùå
**Status**: Mocked

While the daemon creates "Goxel contexts" for each worker, these are mock pointers:
```c
// From daemon_main.c line 800:
daemon->goxel_contexts[i] = (void*)(intptr_t)(i + 1); // Mock context
```

No actual Goxel core functionality is connected.

### 4. MCP Integration ‚ùå
**Status**: Not Started

The Model Context Protocol integration mentioned in documentation:
- No MCP-specific code found
- No bridge between daemon and MCP server
- Migration path not implemented

## üìà Development Progress

### Overall Completion: ~27%

| Component | Progress | Details |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Architecture Design | 100% | Well-designed concurrent system |
| Socket Infrastructure | 90% | Working, needs error handling improvements |
| Worker Pool | 85% | Functional with good concurrency |
| JSON-RPC Parser | 80% | Framework complete, methods missing |
| Daemon Lifecycle | 95% | Robust process management |
| Method Implementation | 0% | No methods implemented |
| Client Library | 0% | Not started |
| Core Integration | 0% | Using mock objects |
| Testing | 15% | Basic infrastructure tests only |
| Documentation | 40% | Extensive but overly optimistic |

## üîß Technical Details

### Build Process
```bash
# Current build command (after fixes):
scons daemon=1

# Required fixes:
1. Added ~20 stub functions for undefined symbols
2. Updated include paths in SConstruct
3. Linked against headless libraries
```

### Runtime Behavior
```bash
# Start daemon
./goxel-daemon --verbose

# Output shows:
Starting Goxel daemon with concurrent processing:
  Worker threads: 4
  Queue size: 1024
  Max connections: 256
Concurrent daemon started successfully
Socket server listening on: /tmp/goxel-daemon.sock

# But actual RPC calls fail:
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"goxel.get_status","id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/goxel-daemon.sock
# Returns: Method not found error
```

### Performance Claims
The documentation claims "700% performance improvement" but this cannot be verified:
- No working methods to benchmark
- No comparison possible with v13.4
- Performance metrics are theoretical

## üéØ Realistic Timeline

Based on current state and remaining work:

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (2-3 weeks)
- Implement core JSON-RPC methods
- Connect real Goxel core contexts
- Basic testing framework

### Phase 2: Client Development (2-3 weeks)
- TypeScript client library
- Connection management
- Type definitions

### Phase 3: Integration (2-3 weeks)
- MCP bridge implementation
- Migration tools
- Integration testing

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Cross-platform testing
- Documentation updates

**Total: 8-12 weeks to production-ready state**

## üí° Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Continue using v13.4** - It's stable and production-ready
2. **Don't migrate yet** - v14.0 provides no functionality
3. **Monitor progress** - Check back in 2-3 months

### For Developers
1. **Start with basic methods** - Implement `echo` or `get_status` first
2. **Use real Goxel core** - Replace mock contexts
3. **Create minimal client** - Even a simple Node.js script would help
4. **Update documentation** - Mark as "IN DEVELOPMENT"

### For Project Management
1. **Reset expectations** - Communicate actual status
2. **Focus on MVP** - Get basic voxel operations working first
3. **Incremental releases** - Ship working features as completed
4. **Honest timelines** - 8-12 weeks for production readiness

## ‚úÖ Positive Aspects

Despite the incomplete state, the v14.0 daemon shows promise:

1. **Solid Architecture** - Concurrent design is well thought out
2. **Clean Code** - Professional implementation quality
3. **Good Foundation** - Infrastructure can support planned features
4. **Scalable Design** - Worker pool allows performance scaling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Concerns

1. **Expectation Gap** - Documentation vastly overstates completion
2. **Integration Complexity** - Connecting all pieces will be challenging
3. **Testing Deficit** - No integration or performance tests
4. **Platform Support** - Only partially tested on macOS

## üìù Conclusion

The Goxel v14.0 daemon is a legitimate and well-architected project in early development. The infrastructure works but provides no actual functionality yet. Users should continue using v13.4 while development continues.

**Current Status**: Early Alpha - Infrastructure Only  
**Recommended Action**: Continue Development, Update Documentation  
**Timeline to Production**: 8-12 weeks minimum
