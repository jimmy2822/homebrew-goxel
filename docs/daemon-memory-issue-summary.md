# Goxel v14.0 Daemon Memory Issue - Executive Summary

## Overview

The Goxel v14.0 daemon crashes when processing multiple `create_project` requests due to fundamental architectural conflicts between the original single-user GUI design and daemon requirements.

## Root Cause

**Shared Memory References**: The daemon maintains both a per-request context (`ctx->image`) and a global state (`goxel.image`). These often point to the same memory, causing use-after-free errors when creating new projects.

```
Request 1: ctx->image = 0x1000, goxel.image = 0x1000
Request 2: Creates new image, deletes 0x1000
Result: goxel.image points to freed memory → CRASH
```

## Why It Happens

1. **Original Design**: Goxel was designed as a single-user GUI app with global state
2. **Daemon Retrofit**: v14.0 added daemon mode without redesigning the architecture  
3. **State Synchronization**: Many operations require `goxel.image = ctx->image`
4. **No Isolation**: No clear ownership or lifecycle management

## Impact

- ❌ Daemon crashes on second project creation
- ❌ Cannot handle concurrent requests
- ❌ Unstable for production use
- ⚠️ Data loss risk

## Solutions Analyzed

### 1. Quick Fix (Immediate)
- Reset all state between projects
- Accept single-project limitation
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Stability**: Medium

### 2. Thread-Local Storage (Short-term) 
- Replace global with thread-local state
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Stability**: High

### 3. Full Refactor (Long-term)
- Remove all global state
- True multi-tenant architecture
- **Effort**: 1-2 months
- **Stability**: Excellent

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Stabilize (v14.0.1)
Apply quick fix to prevent crashes:
- Complete state reset between projects
- Document single-project limitation
- Add health checks

### Phase 2: Improve (v14.1)
Implement thread-local storage:
- Isolate state per worker thread
- Enable limited concurrency
- Maintain API compatibility

### Phase 3: Redesign (v15.0)
Full architectural refactor:
- Eliminate global state
- Proper dependency injection
- Modern C++ with RAII

## Business Impact

### Current State
- 🔴 **Production Ready**: NO
- 🟡 **Development Use**: LIMITED
- 🔴 **Enterprise Use**: NO

### After Quick Fix
- 🟡 **Production Ready**: LIMITED (single-project only)
- 🟢 **Development Use**: YES
- 🟡 **Enterprise Use**: LIMITED

### After Full Fix
- 🟢 **Production Ready**: YES
- 🟢 **Development Use**: YES
- 🟢 **Enterprise Use**: YES

## Key Takeaways

1. **Architectural Mismatch**: GUI app architecture incompatible with daemon requirements
2. **Quick Win Available**: Can stabilize with single-project limitation
3. **Long-term Investment Needed**: Proper fix requires significant refactoring
4. **Clear Migration Path**: Phased approach minimizes risk

## Action Items

1. **Immediate** (This Week):
   - Apply quick fix patches
   - Update documentation with limitations
   - Release v14.0.1-beta

2. **Short-term** (Next Month):
   - Design thread-local architecture
   - Create migration plan
   - Begin v14.1 development

3. **Long-term** (Next Quarter):
   - Architectural design review
   - Stakeholder alignment
   - v15.0 roadmap
