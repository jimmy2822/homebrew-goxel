# Goxel v15.0 Daemon - Status Report

## Executive Summary

The Goxel v15.0 daemon implementation provides a JSON-RPC interface for programmatic 3D voxel editing. While significant progress has been made in stabilizing the daemon, it currently has a critical limitation: **only one request per connection session is reliable**.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- All 15 JSON-RPC methods implemented
- 217 TDD tests passing (100% success rate)
- Memory management issues resolved
  - Fixed use-after-free in JSON parsing
  - Centralized global state management
  - Proper cleanup paths
- Basic daemon functionality working
- Documentation created

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Single Request Limitation**: After processing one request, subsequent requests on the same connection may hang
2. **Response Delivery**: Some timing issues with response delivery to clients
3. **Concurrent Access**: While the architecture supports concurrency, the global state model limits true parallel processing

### ❌ Not Production Ready
The daemon is suitable for development and testing but not recommended for production use due to the single-request limitation.

## Technical Details

### What Works
- Starting the daemon
- Connecting via Unix socket
- Sending a single JSON-RPC request
- Processing the request
- Generating a response
- Basic error handling

### What Doesn't Work Reliably
- Multiple requests per connection
- High-concurrency scenarios
- Long-running connections
- Connection reuse

## Root Cause Analysis

The single-request limitation appears to be related to:
1. State management between requests
2. Socket handling in the monitoring threads
3. Potential deadlocks in the request processing pipeline

## Recommended Usage

### For Development
```python
# Create new connection for each request
for i in range(10):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect("/tmp/goxel.sock")
    
    request = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "goxel.create_project",
        "params": ["Test", 16, 16, 16],
        "id": i
    }
    
    sock.send(json.dumps(request).encode() + b'\n')
    response = sock.recv(4096)
    sock.close()  # Important: close after each request
```

### Not Recommended
```python
# This will likely hang on second request
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect("/tmp/goxel.sock")

for i in range(10):
    request = {...}
    sock.send(json.dumps(request).encode() + b'\n')
    response = sock.recv(4096)  # May hang here after first request
```

## Path Forward

### Short Term (v15.1)
1. Fix the single-request limitation
2. Improve connection handling
3. Add connection timeout/recovery

### Medium Term (v16.0)
1. Implement connection pooling
2. Support WebSocket protocol
3. Add async operation support

### Long Term
1. Multi-project support
2. Distributed architecture
3. Full production readiness

## Testing Approach

To work around current limitations:
1. Use fresh connections for each test
2. Implement connection retry logic
3. Add timeouts to prevent hangs
4. Monitor daemon health between tests

## Conclusion

The Goxel v15.0 daemon represents significant progress toward programmatic voxel editing. While the current implementation has limitations, it provides a solid foundation for future development. The architecture is sound, and the issues are solvable with focused effort on the connection handling and state management systems.

For current use cases that can work within the single-request limitation, the daemon provides reliable functionality with all 15 JSON-RPC methods fully implemented and tested.
