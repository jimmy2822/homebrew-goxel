# Architecture Review Meeting - Week 1

**Meeting Leader**: Sarah Chen, Lead MCP Protocol Integration Specialist  
**Date**: January 31, 2025 (End of Week 1)  
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Attendees**: Full Development Team

## Meeting Objectives

1. Review current 4-layer architecture analysis
2. Present proposed 2-layer architecture
3. Validate MCP handler design
4. Align on implementation approach for Weeks 2-3
5. Identify risks and mitigation strategies

## Agenda

### 1. Current State Analysis (20 min)
**Presenter**: Sarah Chen

- **Current Architecture Overview**
  - 4-layer data flow visualization
  - Performance metrics: 14-22ms overhead per request
  - Memory usage: 130MB additional overhead
  - Complexity issues: 3 protocol translations

- **Key Findings**
  - 45% of processing time spent in protocol translation
  - Triple connection management overhead
  - Error context lost through transformations
  - Maintenance burden of 4 separate components

### 2. Proposed 2-Layer Architecture (25 min)
**Presenter**: Sarah Chen

- **Simplified Architecture**
  ```
  [MCP Client] → [Goxel MCP-Daemon]
  ```
  
- **Benefits Analysis**
  - 60-70% latency reduction (22ms → 7-9ms)
  - 65% memory reduction (130MB → 45MB)
  - Single protocol transformation
  - Simplified debugging and maintenance

- **MCP Handler Design**
  - Direct protocol translation
  - Zero-copy operations
  - Batch operation support
  - Performance monitoring built-in

### 3. Technical Deep Dive (25 min)

#### Protocol Mapping Review
**Focus**: MCP to JSON-RPC mapping completeness

- Current coverage: 70% of MCP tools have direct mappings
- Gap analysis: 10 missing JSON-RPC methods identified
- Parameter transformation strategies
- Error mapping approach

#### MCP Handler Interface
**Focus**: `mcp_handler.h` design validation

- Core data structures
- Translation functions
- Performance considerations
- Integration points with socket server

### 4. Implementation Planning (15 min)
**Facilitator**: Sarah Chen

- **Week 2 Priorities**
  - Michael: Socket server integration
  - Alex: Core translation functions
  - David: Migration tooling
  - Lisa: Documentation updates

- **Week 3 Goals**
  - Complete core implementation
  - Performance validation
  - Migration of existing tools
  - End-to-end testing

### 5. Risk Assessment (5 min)

- **Technical Risks**
  - Backward compatibility with existing MCP clients
  - Performance regression in edge cases
  - Socket handling differences between platforms

- **Mitigation Strategies**
  - Parallel operation during transition
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Performance benchmarking framework

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

### Required Reading
1. `01_current_data_flow_analysis.md` - Understand current architecture
2. `02_mcp_to_jsonrpc_protocol_mapping.md` - Review protocol mappings
3. `03_mcp_handler_interface_design.md` - Familiarize with proposed interface

### Questions to Consider
1. Are there any MCP tools we're missing in the mapping?
2. What edge cases should we handle in the translation layer?
3. How do we ensure zero downtime during migration?
4. What performance metrics should we track?

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Consensus on Architecture**
   - Team agreement on 2-layer approach
   - Validated MCP handler design
   - Clear implementation priorities

2. **Action Items**
   - Assigned Week 2 tasks
   - Identified dependencies
   - Scheduled follow-up reviews

3. **Success Criteria**
   - Sub-10ms end-to-end latency
   - 100% backward compatibility
   - Zero memory leaks
   - Comprehensive error handling
