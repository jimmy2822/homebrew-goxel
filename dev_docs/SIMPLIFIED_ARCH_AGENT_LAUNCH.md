## Launch Sequence

### Step 1: Create Shared Context
```bash
# Create shared knowledge base
mkdir -p /shared/goxel-simplified
cd /shared/goxel-simplified

# Copy essential files
cp /Users/jimmy/jimmy_side_projects/goxel/dev_docs/SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE_TASKS.md .
cp /Users/jimmy/jimmy_side_projects/goxel/CLAUDE.md .

# Create handoff structure
mkdir -p handoffs/{week1,week2,week3,week4,week5,week6}
```

### Step 2: Initialize Progress Tracking
```json
// /shared/goxel-simplified/progress.json

- [ ] All agents understand dependencies
- [ ] Communication channels established

## Handoff Protocol

Each agent must produce a structured handoff at week's end:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent-1",
  "agent_name": "Sarah Chen",
  "week": 1,
  "completed_tasks": [
    {
      "task": "Document current data flow",
      "output": "analysis/data_flow.md",
      "blockers_for_others": []
    }
  ],
  "discoveries": [
    "Found opportunity to reduce serialization by 50%"
  ],
  "handoffs": {
    "agent-2": ["Socket integration points defined in src/daemon/mcp_integration.h"],
    "agent-3": ["Test interfaces ready in tests/mcp/interfaces.h"],
    "agent-4": ["Breaking changes documented in migration/breaking_changes.md"]
  },
  "next_week_dependencies": [
    "Need Michael's socket modifications by Day 8"
  ]
}
```

## Daily Sync Simulation

```markdown
# Daily Standup - Day 3
**Sarah**: MCP mapping 70% complete. Found 5 methods needing special handling.
**Michael**: Daemon profiling done. Startup is 450ms - need optimization.
**Alex**: Dashboard live at http://metrics.local. Tracking 15 metrics.
**David**: User survey sent. 2 responses highlighting WebSocket concerns.
**Lisa**: Wiki structure complete. Need architecture diagram from Sarah.

**Blockers**: None
**Helps Needed**: Lisa needs 30min with Sarah for diagram walkthrough
```

## Risk Monitoring

### Early Warning Signs (Week 1)
- Any agent not delivering daily updates
- Discovery of major architectural conflicts
- Performance baseline >2x worse than expected
- User pushback on migration plan

### Escalation Protocol
1. **Hour 24**: No update from agent â†’ Lead (Sarah) checks in
2. **Hour 48**: Blocking issue â†’ All-hands sync meeting
3. **Day 5**: Behind schedule â†’ Redistribute tasks
4. **Week 1 End**: Major risk identified â†’ Adjust Week 2 plan
