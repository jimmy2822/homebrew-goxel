## Task Distribution Matrix

| Phase | E1 (Lead) | E2 (Daemon) | E3 (Test) | E4 (Migration) | E5 (Docs) |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Week 1 | 5 tasks | 4 tasks | 4 tasks | 4 tasks | 3 tasks |
| Week 2-3 | 12 tasks | 10 tasks | 8 tasks | 6 tasks | 6 tasks |
| Week 3-4 | 8 tasks | 8 tasks | 10 tasks | 10 tasks | 8 tasks |
| Week 5 | 4 tasks | 4 tasks | 5 tasks | 12 tasks | 10 tasks |
| Week 6 | 5 tasks | 6 tasks | 8 tasks | 6 tasks | 10 tasks |
| **Total** | **34** | **32** | **35** | **38** | **37** |

## Critical Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies:
1. **Week 1**: All analysis must complete before Week 2
2. **Week 2**: E1's MCP handler blocks E3's tests
3. **Week 3**: Protocol completion blocks migration tools
4. **Week 4**: Feature parity blocks final testing

### Parallel Opportunities:
1. **Weeks 2-3**: E2, E4, E5 can work independently
2. **Week 3-4**: Testing and documentation parallel to development
3. **Week 5**: All engineers can work on different migration aspects
4. **Week 6**: Cleanup tasks are highly parallel

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync (15 min):
- Each engineer reports blockers
- Dependency handoffs coordinated
- Next 24h priorities aligned

### Weekly Architecture Review:
- Led by Engineer-1
- All engineers present progress
- Adjust allocations based on velocity

### Critical Handoffs:
- E1 → E3: MCP handler ready for testing (Day 10)
- E2 → E4: Dual-mode daemon ready (Day 14)
- E1+E2 → E5: Feature complete for documentation (Day 21)
- E4 → E3: Migration tools ready for testing (Day 28)

## Risk Mitigation Through Allocation

### Coverage Strategy:
- **Primary/Secondary** assignments for critical tasks
