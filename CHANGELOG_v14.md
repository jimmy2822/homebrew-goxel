# Goxel v14.0.0 Changelog

All notable changes from v13.4 to v14.0 are documented here.

## [14.0.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

#### Daemon Architecture (Phase 4 Completion)
- **Daemon Process** (`goxel-daemon`)
  - Persistent background process eliminating startup overhead
  - Unix domain socket server for high-performance IPC
  - Multi-threaded worker pool for concurrent request processing
  - Automatic process lifecycle management
  - Graceful shutdown with cleanup
  - Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP)
  - PID file management for service integration

- **JSON RPC 2.0 API**
  - Full protocol implementation with batching support
  - 30+ methods covering all CLI operations
  - Async notification support
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Request validation and sanitization
  - Method discovery via `rpc.discover`

- **Client Integration**
  - Enhanced CLI with automatic daemon detection
  - TypeScript/Node.js client library
  - Unix socket and TCP support
  - Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
  - Request queuing and timeout handling

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - 700%+ improvement for batch operations
  - Zero-copy message passing where possible
  - Efficient memory pooling
  - Lock-free queue implementation
  - Optimized JSON parsing

#### Service Integration
- **SystemD Support (Linux)**
  - Service unit file with restart policies
  - Socket activation support
  - Resource limits configuration
  - Logging to journal

- **LaunchD Support (macOS)**
  - Launch agent plist configuration
  - Automatic startup on login
  - KeepAlive with crash recovery
  - Console logging integration

#### Configuration System
- **YAML Configuration**
  - Hierarchical configuration with defaults
  - Environment variable overrides
  - Hot-reload without restart
  - Schema validation

#### Monitoring & Debugging
- **Health Endpoints**
  - `daemon.status` - Current daemon state
  - `daemon.stats` - Performance metrics
  - `daemon.connections` - Active client info
  
- **Structured Logging**
  - JSON formatted logs
  - Configurable log levels
  - Automatic log rotation
  - Performance profiling markers

### Changed

#### CLI Enhancements
- **Dual Mode Operation**
  - Automatic daemon detection and usage
  - Transparent fallback to standalone mode
  - `--daemon` flag to force daemon usage
  - `--no-daemon` flag to force standalone

- **Backward Compatibility**
  - All v13.4 commands work unchanged
  - Same command-line syntax
  - Identical output format
  - Exit codes preserved

#### Build System
- **New Build Targets**
  - `scons daemon=1` - Build daemon executable
  - `scons all=1` - Build everything (CLI + daemon + libs)
  - `make release-v14` - Complete release build
  - `make install-daemon` - Install daemon and service files

- **Conditional Compilation**
  - Feature flags for daemon components
  - Platform-specific socket implementations
  - Optional client library builds

### Fixed

#### Performance Issues
- Eliminated repeated process initialization overhead
- Fixed memory fragmentation in long-running operations
- Reduced context switching for batch operations
- Optimized file I/O for concurrent access

#### Reliability Improvements
- Proper cleanup on all exit paths
- Thread-safe error handling
- Race condition fixes in worker pool
- Memory leak fixes in JSON parsing

### Deprecated
- None - Full backward compatibility maintained

### Removed
- None - All v13.4 features retained

### Security
- Unix socket permission controls
- Optional authentication support (disabled by default)
- Input validation for all RPC methods
- Safe JSON parsing with size limits

## Migration Notes

### From v13.4 to v14.0
1. **No Breaking Changes** - Existing scripts work unchanged
2. **Optional Daemon** - Can be enabled for performance
3. **Gradual Migration** - Run both versions side-by-side
4. **MCP Compatible** - MCP server works with both versions

### Performance Considerations
- First operation after daemon start: ~10ms (includes init)
- Subsequent operations: ~1.75ms (7x faster than v13.4)
- Memory usage: 45MB shared vs 33MB per operation

### Platform Notes
- **Linux**: Full feature support with SystemD
- **macOS**: Full feature support with LaunchD  
- **Windows**: Beta daemon support, stable CLI mode
- **BSD**: Daemon supported, manual service setup

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Replaced CLI process spawning with persistent daemon
- Unified error handling across all components
- Standardized logging throughout codebase
- Improved test coverage to 92%
