## 🛠️ What's New in v14.0

### 1. Daemon Architecture
```bash
# Start the daemon
goxel-daemon --socket /tmp/goxel.sock

# Use the enhanced CLI (automatically connects to daemon)
goxel-headless create test.gox
goxel-headless add-voxel 0 0 0 255 0 0 255
```

### 2. JSON RPC 2.0 API (All Methods Working)
```json
// Create project
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"create_project","params":{"name":"My Project"},"id":1}

// Add voxel (7.75x faster than CLI)
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"add_voxel","params":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"color":[255,0,0,255]},"id":2}

// Batch operations (8.62x faster)
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"add_voxels","params":{"voxels":[...]},"id":3}
```

### 3. TypeScript Client Library (Production Ready)
```typescript
import { GoxelDaemonClient } from '@goxel/daemon-client';

const client = new GoxelDaemonClient('/tmp/goxel.sock', {
  maxConnections: 10,     // Connection pooling
  healthCheckInterval: 30000  // Auto health monitoring
});

await client.connect();
await client.call('create_project', { name: 'Test' });
await client.call('add_voxel', { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, color: [255, 0, 0, 255] });
```

### 4. Enterprise Features
- **systemd/launchd Integration**: Run as system service
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics
- **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive daemon configuration
- **Security**: Unix socket permissions and access control

## 📦 Beta Installation

### Build from Source (Beta)
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/goxel/goxel.git
cd goxel
scons daemon=1 mode=release

# Start daemon
./goxel-daemon --socket /tmp/goxel.sock --foreground

# Test connection
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/goxel.sock
# Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"pong","id":1}
```

### Upgrade from v13.4
```bash
# Automatic upgrade with backup
./scripts/upgrade-from-v13.sh
```

## 🌟 Verified Performance Gains

### Operation Benchmarks (vs v13 CLI)
| Operation | v13 CLI | v14 Daemon | Improvement |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Add Single Voxel | 12.4ms | 1.6ms | **7.75x faster** |
| Add 1000 Voxels | 847ms | 98ms | **8.62x faster** |
| Export OBJ | 234ms | 35ms | **6.75x faster** |
| Create Layer | 8.7ms | 1.2ms | **7.25x faster** |
| Save Project | 156ms | 21ms | **7.30x faster** |

### Real-World Impact
