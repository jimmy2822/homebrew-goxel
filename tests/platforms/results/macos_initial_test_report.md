# macOS Platform Test Report - Initial Findings

**Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Platform**: macOS 15.5 (ARM64 - Apple Silicon M1)  
**Daemon Version**: v14.0.0-daemon  
**Test Engineer**: Sarah Johnson (Agent-4)

## Executive Summary

Initial testing on macOS ARM64 has revealed critical issues with the daemon's socket server implementation. The daemon starts successfully but fails to create the Unix domain socket, preventing client connections.

## Test Environment

- **OS Version**: macOS 15.5
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon M1)
- **Kernel**: Darwin 24.5.0
- **Hardware**: Apple M1 (arm64)
- **Test Location**: /Users/jimmy/jimmy_side_projects/goxel/tests/

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Daemon Startup | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Process starts but socket not created |
| Socket Creation | ❌ FAILED | Unix socket file not created |
| Signal Handling | ✅ PASSED | Responds to SIGTERM correctly |
| Memory Usage | ✅ PASSED | Low memory footprint (~1MB) |
| Binary Architecture | ✅ PASSED | Native ARM64 support confirmed |
| Performance | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cannot test without working socket |

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Socket Server Not Creating Unix Socket
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Blocks all JSON RPC functionality  
**Details**: 
- Daemon process starts successfully with correct PID file creation
- Unix socket file is never created at specified path
- No error messages in verbose output
- Process appears to hang in foreground mode

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Starting daemon
/Users/jimmy/jimmy_side_projects/goxel/tests/goxel-daemon \
  --foreground --socket /tmp/test.sock --pid-file /tmp/test.pid

# Result: PID file created, but no socket file
# ls -la /tmp/test.*
-rw-r--r--  1 jimmy  wheel  6 Jul 26 18:01 /tmp/test.pid
# Socket file missing
```

### 2. Daemon Hangs in Foreground Mode
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Cannot properly test or debug  
**Details**:
- When run with --foreground flag, daemon hangs indefinitely
- No output even with --verbose flag
- Process must be killed manually

## Successful Components

### 1. Binary Compilation
- Successfully compiled for ARM64 architecture
- Binary size: 77,680 bytes
- No architecture compatibility issues

### 2. Process Management
- PID file creation works correctly
- Process responds to signals (SIGTERM)
- Clean shutdown when signaled

### 3. Command Line Interface
- Help and version flags work correctly
- Argument parsing functional
- Options properly documented

## Platform-Specific Observations

1. **macOS Security**: No Gatekeeper or code signing issues encountered
2. **File Permissions**: Default file permissions are acceptable (755 for executables)
3. **LaunchDaemon**: Plist file not present in current build
4. **Universal Binary**: Current build is ARM64-only, not a universal binary

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Debug Socket Creation**: Investigate why socket_server_start() is not creating the Unix socket
2. **Add Logging**: Enhance verbose mode to show socket creation steps
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure socket creation errors are properly reported

### Short-term (High Priority)
1. **Fix Foreground Mode**: Resolve hanging issue in foreground mode
2. **Add Socket Tests**: Implement unit tests for socket server functionality
3. **Cross-Architecture Build**: Create universal binary for Intel Mac support

### Medium-term (Normal Priority)
1. **LaunchDaemon Integration**: Create and test plist file for macOS service management
2. **Performance Testing**: Once socket works, validate <2.1ms latency requirement
3. **Stress Testing**: Verify 10+ concurrent client support

## Test Artifacts

- Test scripts: `/tests/platforms/macos/`
- Test logs: `/tests/platforms/results/`
- Basic connection test: `test_daemon_basic.c`

## Next Steps

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Work with Agent-1 (Chen) to debug socket server implementation
2. **Code Review**: Examine daemon_main.c and socket_server.c for macOS-specific issues
3. **Alternative Testing**: Consider testing with mock socket implementation
4. **Linux Testing**: Proceed with Linux platform testing to determine if issue is macOS-specific

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk**: HIGH
- Core functionality (socket communication) is non-functional
- Blocks all JSON RPC operations
- Prevents performance validation
- May indicate deeper architectural issues

## Conclusion

The Goxel v14.0 daemon on macOS ARM64 has a critical blocker preventing socket creation. This must be resolved before meaningful functional or performance testing can proceed. The issue appears to be in the socket server implementation rather than platform-specific code.

**Test Status**: BLOCKED - Awaiting socket server fix  
**Recommendation**: Escalate to development team for immediate resolution
