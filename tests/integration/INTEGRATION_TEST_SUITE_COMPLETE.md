# Goxel v14.0 Integration Test Suite - Ready for Use

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive integration test suite for the v14 daemon. The suite is ready to validate all functionality once the socket issue is resolved.

## What I've Created

### 1. Test Infrastructure

#### Main Test Orchestrator
- **`full_stack_test.sh`**: Complete test runner that executes all test categories
  - Supports selective test execution with command-line options
  - Generates detailed reports with pass/fail statistics
  - Handles daemon lifecycle management
  - Color-coded output for easy reading

#### Quick Validation
- **`quick_socket_test.sh`**: Focused test for socket communication
  - Starts daemon and verifies socket creation
  - Tests basic client connection
  - Sends JSON-RPC request and validates response
  - Perfect for debugging the current socket issue

#### Test Programs
- **`test_e2e_workflow.c`**: Comprehensive end-to-end test suite
  - Tests complete workflows from startup to shutdown
  - Validates all API methods
  - Includes concurrent client testing
  - Performance measurements

- **`test_specific_scenarios.c`**: Targeted test scenarios
  - Individual tests that can be run with `-t` option
  - Covers: startup, connect, multi_connect, shutdown
  - Method tests: echo, version, status, create_project, add_voxel
  - Stress tests: 10 and 50 concurrent clients

### 2. Test Categories

#### Basic Connectivity (4 tests)
- Daemon startup and socket creation
- Single client connection
- Multiple client connections (5 clients)
- Graceful shutdown

#### JSON-RPC Methods (16 tests)
- Basic: echo, version, status, ping
- Voxel ops: create_project, add_voxel, get_voxel, remove_voxel
- File ops: save_project, load_project, export_model
- Batch operations
- Error handling: invalid method, invalid params

#### TypeScript Client (3 test suites)
- Connection management tests
- Connection pool tests
- Health monitor tests

#### Performance (4 benchmarks)
- Latency benchmark (target: <2.1ms)
- Throughput test (target: >1000 ops/s)
- Memory profiling (target: <50MB)
- Comparison with CLI baseline

#### Stress Tests (5 scenarios)
- 10 concurrent clients
- 50 concurrent clients
- 1000 sequential operations
- Burst load test
- Memory leak detection (5 minutes)
- Optional: 1-hour stability test

### 3. Validation and Reporting

#### Results Validator
- **`validate_results.py`**: Analyzes test results
  - Checks against performance targets
  - Determines production readiness
  - Generates JSON summary
  - Clear pass/fail criteria

#### Report Generation
- Markdown reports with timestamps
- Performance metrics in JSON
- Test execution logs
- Production readiness assessment

### 4. Build System

- **`Makefile`**: Builds all test programs
  - `make all`: Build everything
  - `make run`: Run full test suite
  - `make run-basic`: Basic tests only
  - `make run-stress`: Stress tests only
  - `make quick-test`: Quick socket validation

## How to Use

### Step 1: Quick Socket Validation
```bash
cd /Users/jimmy/jimmy_side_projects/goxel/tests/integration
make quick-test
```

This will immediately tell you if the socket issue is resolved.

### Step 2: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Build and run everything
make run

# Or run specific categories
make run-basic      # Just connectivity and methods
make run-stress     # Just stress tests
make run-performance # Just performance benchmarks
```

### Step 3: Validate Results
```bash
# After tests complete
python3 validate_results.py
```

## Expected Results When Working

### Successful Quick Test
```
✓ Daemon running (PID: 12345)
✓ Socket communication working!
The daemon can receive and respond to JSON-RPC requests.
```

### Successful Full Test
```
Test Summary:
  Total: 40+
  Passed: 40+
  Failed: 0
  Success Rate: 100%

✅ The v14 daemon is READY for production deployment!
```

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Validation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Latency | <2.1ms | ✓ Measured in latency_benchmark |
| Throughput | >1000 ops/s | ✓ Measured in throughput_test |
| Memory | <50MB | ✓ Measured in memory_profiling |
| Concurrent Clients | 50+ | ✓ Tested in stress tests |
| Success Rate | >99% | ✓ Calculated from all tests |

## Current Status

⚠️ **Waiting for Socket Fix**: The test suite is complete and ready to run, but requires the socket communication issue to be resolved first.

Once the debugging agent fixes the socket issue:
1. Run `make quick-test` to verify the fix
2. Run `make run` for full validation
3. Review the generated reports
4. If all tests pass, the v14 daemon is ready for production!
