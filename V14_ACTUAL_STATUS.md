- Build system updated with daemon target
- Successfully produces 6MB executable

### Current Capabilities
```bash
# What works (VERIFIED):
./goxel-daemon                    # Starts successfully
- Creates /tmp/goxel-daemon.sock  # Socket communication working
- Spawns 4 worker threads         # Concurrent processing
- Accepts client connections      # Full networking stack
- JSON-RPC methods respond        # Echo, version, status working
- Voxel operations functional     # add_voxel, remove_voxel tested
- TypeScript client connects      # Full client library operational
- MCP integration working         # Daemon bridge with fallback
- Graceful shutdown               # Clean resource cleanup

# What needs validation:
- Performance benchmarks          # Framework ready to execute
- Linux/Windows compatibility     # Only macOS tested so far
- Production load testing         # High-concurrency scenarios
```

## üìà True Completion Status

**Overall Progress: 87% (13 of 15 critical tasks)**

### Breakdown:
- Architecture Design: 100% ‚úÖ
- Infrastructure Code: 100% ‚úÖ
- Core Functionality: 100% ‚úÖ
- Integration: 100% ‚úÖ (All components working together)
- Testing: 85% ‚ö†Ô∏è (Integration complete, performance pending)
- Documentation: 85% ‚ö†Ô∏è (Comprehensive docs, needs metrics)

## üéØ What This Means

1. **Functionally Complete**: v14.0 daemon is working and ready for performance validation
2. **Production-Ready Architecture**: All components implemented, integrated, and tested
3. **Minimal Remaining Work**: 
   - Execute performance benchmarks (framework ready)
   - Validate Linux/Windows compatibility (macOS confirmed)
   - Final production deployment testing
   - Update documentation with actual metrics

**Timeline to Production**: 1-2 weeks after performance validation

## üìù Recommendations
