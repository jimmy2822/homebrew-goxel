## 🔄 Migration from v13.4

### Zero Breaking Changes
- All v13.4 CLI commands work identically
- Existing scripts require no modifications
- MCP server compatible with both modes
- File formats unchanged

### Recommended Migration Path
1. Install v14.0 alongside v13.4
2. Test with `goxel-headless --daemon test`
3. Enable daemon service for production
4. Update MCP server to use daemon mode
5. Remove v13.4 after validation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the daemon
./goxel-daemon --socket /tmp/goxel.sock --foreground

# Test with echo
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"echo","params":{"test":123},"id":1}' | nc -U /tmp/goxel.sock

# Use TypeScript client
npm install @goxel/daemon-client

# Example code
import { GoxelDaemonClient } from '@goxel/daemon-client';
const client = new GoxelDaemonClient('/tmp/goxel.sock');
await client.connect();
await client.call('add_voxel', { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, color: [255, 0, 0, 255] });
```
